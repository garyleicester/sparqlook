A simple, lightweight, single php file tool for exploring SPARQL endpoints.

I'm intuitive. And nosey. And impatient. I want to take a look. I built this to let me poke around a(ny) SPARQL endpoint.

Best if you know the URI you want to start at as well as the endpoint address, but leaving the URI blank will retrieve some suggested starting points.

I mostly work with SKOS thesauri, so currently leans a little too heavily that way.
